# adventofcode
This is where I post my solutions to advent of code

This is going to be a pretty quick description as there is very little to elaborate on. This is where I put all my advent of code answers, I started coding with python around maybe 20 days ago, hence my code being so bad you dont even know what's happening. I am getting better and learning more syntax for python, so my code in the future will hopefully be much more readable. *pls don't bully*
